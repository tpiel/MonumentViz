    <h1>Group 7 Data Visualion Project </h1>

    <h2>Basic Info</h2>
    <p>Confederate Monuments: Observing Their Origin and Desecrations</p>
    <p><u>Auhors:</u></p>
    <p>Tyler Piel tpiel@g.clemson.edu C75958864</p>


    <a href="https://github.com/tpiel/MonumentViz">Project Repository Link </a>

    <h2>Project Objectives:</h2>
    <p> (info) </p>

    <h2>Data </h2>
    <p> This dataset provides multiple tables about eight unique tales to showcase information about confederate monuments.</p>
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W4H2qa2THM1ni53QYZftGob_k_Bf9HreFAtCERfjCIU/edit?pli=1#gid=502314093">link to the data set </a>
    <p>  </p>

    <h2>Data Processing </h2>
    <p> Some data cleaning that we would have to do is on the table that’s labeled Dedications Per Year when we are looking at the amount of monuments </p>
    <p>removed by each state. This has the year 2020 above 2021 when it should be below and there is a blank item for one of the rows that’s filled. </p>
    <p>This is the only discrepancy that I see in the dataset.  </p>

    <h2>Visualization Design </h2>
    <p> Prototype 1 - basic line chart</p>
    <svg id="proto1"></svg>
    <script src="script1.js"></script>

    <h2>Must Have Features</h2>
    <p> The project would be a failure if we don’t find anything useful about the monuments by not displaying their distribution in each state </p>
    <p>and their change of status over time. The features would be the different colors that represent the type of symbol, and the (line/bar) graph </p>
    <p>for each state. This is what answers our question about the history of these monuments and how current events have changed the perspective </p>
    <p>and feelings toward these monuments.</p>

    <h2>Optional Features</h2>
    <p> Something optional could be an interactive visualization that shows demographic information </p>
    <p>about a certain place and how it can affect the population.</p>

    <h2>Project Schedule </h2>
    <p> Oct. 18-24: Monday: Gather all the data and data clean up, Wednesday: Create svg objects, Friday: Edit objects</p>
    <p>Oct.25-31: Monday: Continue editing the visualization, Wednesday: Be halfway finished, Friday: Have Legends and Bar Graph done</p>
    <p>Nov. 1-7: Finish the monuments over time graph. Have the fully functional visualization prepared for the peer eval </p>
    <p>Nov. 8-14: On Monday critique visual encodings. On Wednesday qritique Interaction Techniques. On Friday critique the design quality. </p>
    <p>Have the everything ready and submit to Canvas on Saturday.</p>
    <p>Nov. 14-21: Prepare the single slides with team members and project title</p>
    <p>Nov. 22-28: Prepare for Oral Presentation on 30th. Make flash cards if necessary to say all the main points.</p>
